 # REST-API

 ## A simple rest-api with express 
 
 
 ### The task was to create a simple rest-api with Node.js and Express.js
 ### We would use four endpoints that do what they are created for
 ### GET -
 ### POST - 
 ### PUT - 
 ### DELETE - 

 ## I have done all off theses endpoints.
 ### I have 4 endpoints that meet the requirements each endpoint must perform
 ### I have a Server.rest file where you can reach these endpoints and where the information is saved locally
 ### I have used GIT to push my repo to GITHUB
 ### And i have a README.md file like you see ;)

 

 ## HOW TO START

### Start the script by typing ' npm install ', then open up your terminal and type ' nodemon start' 

### If you open the file Server.rest you can test the rest-api code there by sending the diffrent endpoints.
